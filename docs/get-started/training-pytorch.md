# Get started with Large Model Training with ORTModule
{: .no_toc }

`onnxruntime-training`'s `ORTModule` offers a high performance training engine for models defined using the `PyTorch` frontend. `ORTModule` is designed to accelerate the training of large models without needing to change either the model definition or the training code.

Using the ORTModule class wrapper, ONNX RuntimeÂ runs the forward and backward pass of the training script using an optimized automatically-exported ONNX computation graph.

## ORT Training Example
In this example we will go over how to use ORT for Training a model with PyTorch.

```sh
# Installs the torch_ort and onnxruntime-training python packages
pip install torch-ort
# Configures onnxruntime-training to work with user's PyTorch installation
python -m torch_ort.configure
```

**Note**: This installs the default version of the `torch-ort` and `onnxruntime-training` packages that are mapped to specific versions of the CUDA libraries. Refer to the install options in [ONNXRUNTIME.ai](https://onnxruntime.ai).

 - Add ORTModule in the `train.py`

```diff
+  from torch_ort import ORTModule
   .
   .
   .
-  model = build_model() # Users PyTorch model
+  model = ORTModule(build_model())
```
